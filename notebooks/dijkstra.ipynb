    "Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular graph search algorithm used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It works by iteratively selecting the node with the minimum distance from a set of unvisited nodes and updating the distances of its neighboring nodes. Dijkstra's algorithm is commonly used in navigation systems, network routing protocols, and other applications that involve finding the shortest path."
