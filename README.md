# Algorithms w/ Ferg
Implementations of the algorithms and data structures in [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms), along with accompanying notes where appropriate.

It will also contain drills and exercises taken from [C++ Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/cppcrashcourse), alongside any exercises and/or projects I decide to implement along the way.

## Structure
[notebooks](./notebooks), predictably, contains the Jupyter notebooks with Python implementations of the algorithms in _Grokking Algorithms_. Many of these implementations have analogs in [Coconut](https://coconut-lang.org/) to emphasize recursive structure or demonstrate their expression in a purely functional style.

[cpp](./cpp), also predictably, contains drills, exercises, etc., for C++. Hopefully, these should be useful references for other learners aiming to learn via an "idiom-first" approach, but if not, I guess I don't care :share:
